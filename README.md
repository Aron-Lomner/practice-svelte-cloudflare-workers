**Svelte Project Deployment with Pages and Workers**

This repository contains a simple Svelte project aimed at helping me learn and practice deploying Svelte applications using Pages and Workers.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/svelte-pages-workers.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd svelte-pages-workers
   npm install
   ```

3. **Development Mode:**
   To run the project in development mode, use:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start a development server and open the application in your default browser.

4. **Production Build:**
   To build the project for production, use:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This will generate optimized production-ready assets.
